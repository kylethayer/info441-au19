## Course Work

This course will be evaluated based on 6 assignments (70% of grade),  in class+lab exercises (10% of grade), and a final project (20% of grade).

All assignments will be done in teams of 2-4 people. You will turn in your own copy of the code with your own additional comments to show your understanding of the code. You will be graded on the code, your personal comments on the code, and on your role as a team member. We will evaluate your role as a team member based on the team's feedback and on our own observations. (If you are having any difficulty with your team, let us know early).



### Calculation of Final Grades

Canvas tracks grades on a percentage scale. To convert those to a 4.0 scale we will use [the standard iSchool conversion chart](https://faculty.washington.edu/dlsinfo/grading/grade-conversion-chart.pdf). 

BTW: Canvas is already configured to calculate your final grade considering the previously described 90/10 grading weights and this conversion scale.

### Late Work / missing labs

To encourage you to keep on schedule with projects, we will deduct 10% of the possible points per 24-hour period that your submission is late, with a one hour initial grace period. For example, if the assignment is worth 100 points and your submission is between 1 and 24 hours late, the maximum you can receive on the assignment is 90 points. If your submission is between 24 and 48 hours late, the maximum you can receive is 80 points.

That said, we realize that sometimes life gets complicated and you might need a little extra time to finish a particular challenge. To give you a little flexibility you have 5 free late days that you can spend throughout the quarter. Each late day gives you a free 24-hour extension on the challenge. Unless you specify otherwise, we will use your late days for any work you submit late. After you exhaust all your late days, the normal late penalties will start to accrue.

Additionally we allow you to miss 2 of the lab excersizes and still get full points on that portion of the grade.

If something tragic occurs during the quarter, please let us know and we can work out something.


## Course Rules

In addition to the standard [iSchool and UW academic policies](https://depts.washington.edu/infodocs/academic_policies/) that apply to all of our courses, the following rules also apply to this course.
